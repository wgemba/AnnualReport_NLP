We examine the effect of pure (product differentiation or cost leadership) versus hybrid (a mix of product differentiation and cost leadership) business strategies on the cost of equity capital. Our results suggest that firms with a pure, relative to a hybrid, business strategy have a significantly lower cost of equity, and the cost of equity effect is equally driven by pure product differentiation and pure cost leadership strategies. We also find that firms following a pure business strategy are associated with lower systematic risk. Further, the lower cost of equity effect of a pure product differentiation strategy is more pronounced in high-technology industries and in regions with greater innovative capital. Our findings are robust to an array of robustness checks including change specification regressions and various methods for addressing endogeneity.

I. INTRODUCTION
This study investigates how the cost of equity capital is affected by the different business strategies firms adopt. Despite prior research ([65]; [22]) emphasizing the importance of business risks to equity pricing, existing studies in the accounting literature have primarily focused on the effect of information risks emanating from managerial discretion on equity pricing (e.g., [26]; [64]; [148]; [ 8]; [11]). While some recent studies explore how the cost of equity capital is affected by factors capturing specific types of operational business risks, such as customer concentration ([49]) and information technology investments ([51]), there is no evidence on how equity pricing is affected by business risk emanating from the strategic orientation of firms.

This is an important extension to consider since business strategy plays an important role in shaping the business model and determining specific operational environment factors such as product and market domains, technology, and organizational structure ([132], [133]; [192]), which have been related to cost of equity capital in prior studies (e.g., [49]; [51]). As such, it is plausible that business strategy is a primal factor in influencing the cost of equity capital through determining firms' exposure to business and systematic risks. The relevance of business strategy to investors is underlined by regulators requiring the firms to describe their business model and strategy as well as business risks stemming from their business and operating models under items 1 and 1A of their 10-K filings, respectively.[ 1] As such, it is surprising that the existing literature has not examined whether and how firms' business strategy affects the investors' required rate of return. This lack of evidence is noteworthy since investors have been shown to have an interest in monitoring the strategic initiatives of firms ([189]), and firms have been shown to be conscientious of how investors may view their business strategy ([53]; [105]).[ 2] Our study expands this stream of research by examining how the rate of return required by equity investors on their investments is affected by the type of business strategies that firms adopt, namely pure and hybrid business strategies.

[158] proposes that firms seeking to attain competitive success should focus on either cost leadership or product differentiation (referred to as a pure business strategy), but not both (referred to as a hybrid business strategy). The competitive advantage for pure strategy firms that focus on product differentiation is induced by operating within a broad product market domain and pursuing innovative responses to their rapidly changing environment (e.g., developing new products and markets). The development of innovative products attracts and retains customers due to inelastic demand for innovative products ([167]), which offers such firms greater protection from promotions and price-based appeals from competitors ([23]). This can allow pure strategy firms that focus on product differentiation to insulate themselves against economic downturns ([167]), implying lower exposure to systematic risk.

On the other hand, the competitive advantage for pure strategy firms that pursue cost leadership arises from operating in narrow and stable product and market domains, and through focusing on cost control, efficiency, and product quality. The narrow product domain of these firms allows them to realize greater cost savings through economies of scale, proprietary technology, and differential access to raw materials ([45]; [154]; [158]). Continuous and mass productions of the same products render cost leadership firms as major buyers of a supply or material, which allows such firms to realize economies of scale and increased bargaining power ([172]). Suppliers tend to offer major buyers materials at cheaper and stable rates to prevent them from switching to competing suppliers ([178], [179]). Such relationship with the major suppliers reduces cost leadership firms' exposure to price increases from suppliers during economic downturns. These attributes enable cost leadership firms to more effectively absorb or prevent suppliers' price increases, discourage price war by competitors, and suppress new market entrants. This allows pure cost leadership firms to outperform their industry peers even in deteriorating economic conditions ([ 3]; [167]), which signals lower exposure to systematic risk.

[158] argues that firms that adopt a hybrid strategy, which simultaneously pursues both product differentiation and cost leadership, require significant investment in diverse facilities, human capital, and organizational structure. This dilutes the strategical focus of the firm, rendering the firm stuck "in the middle" and compromising its competitive edge ([158]; [185]; [176]). Collectively, the above arguments suggest that an unambiguous strategical direction allows firms that pursue a pure business strategy (either product differentiation or cost leadership) to better utilize resources, knowledge, and skills that result in lower business and systematic risks.

In contrast to [158], other organizational theorists such as [132], [133]) and [127] propose that a hybrid business strategy can also provide firms with a competitive edge through delicate structures and investments that allow them to simultaneously pursue both product differentiation and cost leadership. The ever-changing dynamics of today's global economy can place hybrid business strategy firms in a stronger position to respond to frenzied market conditions through experimentation and learning across multiple areas ([ 6]; [176]). This can provide hybrid strategy firms with greater insulation against adverse market conditions ([163]). Overall, given the competing arguments on the impacts of pure and hybrid business strategies on a firm's exposure to business and systematic risks, whether and how the rate of return required by investors is affected by the firm's choice of pure or hybrid business strategy remains an empirical question that we address in this study.

We evaluate the impact of pure versus hybrid strategic orientation on the cost of equity capital using a sample of 8,036 firm-year observations from 2000 through 2014 by regressing firm-specific implied cost of equity capital on an indicator variable separating firms with pure and hybrid business strategies and on other known determinants of the cost of equity capital. In constructing our measure of business strategy, we follow recent accounting studies ([16]; [89]; [17]; [18]) and first compute a composite business strategy index based on six firm characteristics representing firms' research intensity, marketing effort, historical growth, operational efficiency, technological efficiency, and organizational stability.[ 3] Given that a focus on product differentiation and cost leadership demands contrasting structures, processes, and investments, firms with a focus on product differentiation (cost leadership) are expected to have higher (lower) innovation, marketing initiatives, and growth, and lower (higher) efficiency and stability. Based on this premise, we identify firms with a pure business strategy as those residing toward the opposite ends of our business strategy index and firms with a hybrid business strategy as those that occupy the middle of the index continuum.

Our results suggest that firms with a pure business strategy are associated with lower cost of equity capital. The magnitude of the difference between the cost of equity capital for firms following pure versus hybrid strategy is between 29 and 68 basis points (depending on our individual implied cost of equity proxy), which is economically significant.[ 4] Our findings are robust when we separately test the two types of pure business strategies (i.e., product differentiation and cost leadership) relative to the hybrid strategy and when we adjust our key assumptions (e.g., industry definition) for constructing our business strategy proxy. We also conduct several tests that suggest our results are not driven by any one of the six individual variables used to construct the business strategy. Further, our results are robust to using propensity score matching and the impact threshold for a confounding variable procedure, as well as to controlling for lagged implied cost of equity and firm fixed effects, to account for any endogeneity bias. We also employ a change specification regression to show that a long-term move toward a pure business strategy is associated with a reduction in the implied cost of equity capital. Collectively, our findings suggest that investors require lower (higher) rates of return on their investments in firms adopting pure (hybrid) business strategy.

Since traditional asset pricing frameworks (e.g., [175]; [121]; [113]) propose that only systematic risk is nondiversifiable and priced in equilibrium, the basis of our results, therefore, hinges on the assumption that firms that adopt a pure business strategy have a lower systematic risk. Consistent with this view, we document a lower (higher) systematic risk in pure (hybrid) business strategy firms. Additionally, we show that firms embracing a pure business strategy have a lower idiosyncratic risk, relative to firms embracing a hybrid business strategy.[ 5]

Our main analyses focus on the cost of equity differences between firms that follow pure and hybrid business strategies rather than drawing comparisons between the effects of the two types of pure business strategies. This is because the seminal studies on firm strategy (e.g., [158]; [132]) generally debate the relative merits of pure versus hybrid business strategies on enhancing firm competitiveness, which can have consequences for the cost of equity capital through affecting exposure to systematic risk. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that certain settings can allow firms pursuing a specific type of pure strategy to realize lower cost of equity capital. Consistent with this view, results from our additional analyses reveal that firms following a pure product differentiation business strategy realize lower implied cost of equity capital relative to firms following a pure cost differentiation strategy in high-technology industries and regions with higher innovative capital (measured using the number of patents issued per capita in metropolitan statistical areas), which present more favorable conditions for pure product differentiation strategy firms to exploit resourcing and market opportunities that further reduce their systematic risk.

Our findings extend the stream of studies that have focused on investigating the relationships between pure and hybrid business strategies and firm performance ([180]; [185]; [33]; [85]) by examining the cost of equity capital effects of these business strategies. It is difficult to deduce the effect of business strategy on the cost of equity capital from prior studies that have linked business strategy to market-based measures of firm performance (e.g., [187]) because investors' valuation of firms is affected by both the expected cash flows and the cost of equity capital.[ 6] Our study provides direct evidence on how business strategy affects a specific aspect of equity valuation (i.e., cost of equity) rather than a broader interest in understanding investor perceptions. Further, while prior studies (e.g., [68]; [87]) have considered the valuation effects of the individual firm characteristics (e.g., R&D, efficiency) that we use to construct our firm strategy proxies, there are at least two reasons why it may be difficult to use the findings of those studies to infer the cost of equity capital effects of pure and hybrid business strategies. First, examining the linear effects of individual firm characteristics does not allow for a precise comparison of pure and hybrid strategies since these strategies typically reside toward both ends of the business strategy continuum. Second, business strategy is a difficult concept to capture empirically, which, consequently, requires researchers to simultaneously consider multiple firm characteristics when measuring business strategy ([16]; [89]; [17]; [18]). The construction of a composite business strategy measure addresses these objectives and accounts for industry heterogeneity by comparing firms to their industry peers, thereby allowing firms with pure product differentiation, pure cost leadership, and hybrid strategies to coexist in the same industry. Our study further extends the business strategy literature by documenting how the effect of business strategy on the cost of equity capital can vary in different industry and regional settings. Collectively, our findings can help firms better understand the implications of pursuing a pure business strategy at the expense of a hybrid business strategy on their cost of equity capital, which can promote more informed strategic and financing decisions.

II. PRIOR LITERATURE AND RESEARCH QUESTION
Business strategy fundamentally influences a firm's business model and operating environment ([166]; [16]; [145]), thereby dictating how firms structure their entrepreneurial, engineering, and administrative processes to achieve their stipulated long-term objectives ([192]; [132]). Among various strategy typologies, [158] generic competitive strategies have been most widely used not only in academic research exploring the relationships between firm strategy and various aspects of firm outcomes, but also in practice to inform management's formulation of firm strategy ([31]; [185]). [158] proposes two distinct types of generic competitive strategies: cost leadership and product differentiation,[ 7] asserting that firms can achieve a competitive advantage over other firms by pursuing a business strategy that focuses on either cost leadership or product differentiation (i.e., pure strategy), but not both (i.e., hybrid strategy). Several prior studies examine the impact of pure and hybrid business strategies on various facets of firm performance such as operating margin ([185]), Tobin's q ([187]), return on sales, return on investment, rate of sales growth, net profit, and cash flow ([85]). While some studies link the adoption of a pure strategy to superior firm performance ([46]; [185]; [33]; [85]), other studies show that firms pursuing a hybrid business strategy perform equivalently well ([31]; [112]) or even better ([180]; [187]).

The equity pricing literature suggests that the business risks arising from a firm's business model and operating environment can have implications for the cost of equity capital ([141]; [49]). However, despite how business strategy affects firm exposure to business risks ([16]), no prior empirical study has investigated the cost of equity capital effects of pure and hybrid business strategies. This study seeks to fill this gap.

Pure Strategy and Cost of Equity
Under [158] framework, firms that pursue a pure cost leadership strategy gain a competitive edge by operating in narrow and stable product and market domains and continuously enhancing core technologies to improve product quality and cost control.[ 8] Conversely, the competitive advantage for firms pursuing pure product differentiation is typically achieved through operating in a broad product market domain and rapidly changing environment, with the aim of exploiting new product and market opportunities and adopting flexible technologies and organizational structures.[ 9] As such, the pursuit of a pure business strategy is expected to provide clear direction and market positioning ([158]). This can allow pure strategy firms to avoid mutually exclusive trade-offs in the configuration of value activities ([158]; [176]) because cost leadership and product differentiation strategies require different and incompatible investments, resource commitments, production processes, organizational structures, monitoring mechanisms, and managerial remuneration design ([132]; [159]; [103]). The accurate identification of the resource bundles under a single strategy should enhance a firm's competitive strategy ([158]; [96]).

[158], [159], [160]) forewarns that firms attempting to simultaneously pursue both cost leadership and product differentiation strategies (i.e., a hybrid business strategy) are likely to get "stuck in the middle" because such a strategy will require the adoption of incompatible capabilities and systems. As a result, hybrid strategy firms may not be able to fully benefit from the gains realized by firms pursuing a pure strategy of cost leadership or product differentiation ([185]; [176]). Even proponents of the hybrid strategy (e.g., [132]) acknowledge that a hybrid strategy challenges firms to adopt costly and complicated business structures to delicately balance their pursuit of both innovation and efficiency. For example, a hybrid strategy simultaneously requires the harmonization of rigid controls and monitoring necessary for cost leadership and initiatives such as decentralization and employee empowerment, which are imperative for innovation. Moreover, a hybrid strategy can be easier for competitors to imitate, exposing firms to higher levels of competition and, thus, presents significant business risks through threatening the long-term survival of firms ([169]; [186]).

In support, [10] show that both pure cost leadership and pure product differentiation strategies generate favorable and equivalent effects on contemporaneous firm performance. In fact, several studies propose that the focus on pure product differentiation or pure cost efficiency helps alleviate the effects of economic downturns and external shocks, which can reduce their exposure to overall market (i.e., systematic) risks. For example, cost leaders can gain a larger market share and/or earn higher profits by offering cost-efficient products ([45]; [154]; [134]). Effective products at cheaper and stable costs also discourage price wars by competitors and suppress new market entrants. Collectively, these factors can play a vital role in maintaining and enhancing a competitive edge, which helps insulate firms from higher systematic risk in economic hard times ([82]; [182]). Further, during economic downturns, consumers with less disposable income become more price sensitive, consequently rethinking their contracts and relationship with suppliers and adjusting their spending patterns accordingly ([153]; [165]). [115] suggest that consumers seek suppliers that can offer them similar products or services at a lower price during recessions. As such, cost leaders, by continuously offering cost-effective products, can maintain and even increase market share by retaining and attracting cost-conscious, belt-tightening consumers during downturns.

Pure product differentiation firms, on the other hand, insulate themselves from higher systematic risk by creating price inelasticity in customer demand. Specifically, pure product differentiation firms create intangible assets with intensive innovation and advertising that fosters customer loyalty by rendering products less easily substitutable ([130]), and by boosting investor recognition that results in broader stock ownership of the firm ([76]; [67]). The brand equity created results in consumers being less sensitive to prices ([ 3]; [106]; [ 2]) and promotions and price-based appeals from competitors ([23]), even in economic downturns ([167]; [164]). This allows such firms to charge premium prices to offset the extra costs incurred ([21]; [ 2]) and realize higher profit margins ([ 9]). [177] and [128] provide evidence that these channels successfully insulate firms that pursue innovative initiatives (e.g., R&D and advertising) from stock market downturns, thereby reducing their systematic risk.

The above arguments suggest that pure cost leadership and pure product differentiation business strategies can reduce a firm's exposure to systematic risk, resulting in a lower cost of equity capital.[10]

Hybrid Strategy and Cost of Equity Capital
Advocates of hybrid business strategy, however, claim that it is possible for firms to realize greater competitive advantage by simultaneously pursuing a mix of cost leadership and product differentiation initiatives. Some studies (e.g., [163]) propose that changes in supply and demand conditions require the simultaneous pursuit of both low costs and product differentiation initiatives to increase firm performance. According to [142], industrial structural factors critically influence the success of a cost leadership strategy, whereas customer tastes primarily influence the success of a differentiation strategy. Since both factors are independent and coexist in many industries, a hybrid strategy is positioned to yield better performance. Other studies suggest that the diversified focus of a hybrid strategy allows firms to better respond to changing market conditions ([104]; [151]; [ 6]; [176]). [90] claims that there are industry peculiarities where the low-cost position is difficult to achieve. Thus, firms may have a higher likelihood of surviving by adopting a hybrid strategy. [155] suggest that a pure strategy exposes firms to customer risks related to meeting key expectations such as quality, reliability, style, novelty, convenience, service, and price. A hybrid strategy can meet the above expectations and make firms more adaptive to changes in customer preference, market, and technology ([138]; [25]). This may allow firms with a hybrid strategy to more effectively insulate themselves from systematic risk through possessing a greater scope of control over the nature and timing of their investments and other business decisions ([72]). For example, they can focus on promoting cost-efficient products during economic contraction and defer the introduction of new products until economic expansion. Consistent with this view, [190] find that firms with a hybrid strategy outperform their pure strategy counterparts during an economic downturn. These arguments suggest lower exposure to systematic risk and, consequently, lower cost of equity capital in hybrid strategy firms.

Ultimately, given the above competing arguments, whether the cost of equity capital is negatively or positively influenced by the pursuit of a pure, relative to a hybrid, strategy remains an empirical question that we address in this study.

III. RESEARCH DESIGN AND DATA
We employ an ordinary least squares regression to investigate the impact of pure versus hybrid business strategies on the cost of equity capital measured by the implied cost of equity. To account for correlations among error terms within firms, following [156] and [74], we estimate our main regression using standard errors clustered by firms. Our regression model is summarized as:

Dependent Variable: The Implied Cost of Equity
We compute a firm's implied cost of equity three months following the fiscal year-end based on the models developed by [55], [37], [73], and [71], and denote the implied cost of equity estimates from these four models as rEST, rCT, rGM, and rGLS, respectively. Given the unique assumptions adopted by the different implied cost of equity models[11] and the lack of consensus on the superiority of any individual model in estimating the cost of equity,[12] we follow [80] and [119] and employ the equally weighted average of rEST, rCT, rGM, and rGLS (denoted rAVG) as our main dependent variable in all analyses.[13]

Test Variable: Pure Business Strategy
Consistent with prior studies (e.g., [185]), we classify firms with a focus on product differentiation or cost leadership as pure strategy firms. To construct our pure business strategy measure (PURITY), we first compute business strategy scores following recent accounting studies ([16]; [89]; [17]; [18]).[14]Appendix A presents a detailed description of how the business strategy score is constructed. We compute the business strategy scores based on the ranked quintile scores of six variables (research intensity, marketing, historical growth, operational efficiency, technological efficiency, and organizational stability) using the rolling prior five-year data within each two-digit SIC industry, whereby a quintile ranked score of 1 ( 5) is representative of firms with a pure cost leadership (product differentiation) strategy. The sum of the six quintile rank scores determines the business strategy score for each observation. This approach accounts for industry heterogeneity by comparing firms to their industry peers, allowing for the possibility that firms with a pure product differentiation or cost leadership strategy coexist in the same industry ([16]).

We classify an observation as a pure cost leadership (product differentiation) strategy if the business strategy score lies between 6 and 11 (25 and 30) inclusive.[15] These observations collectively represent pure strategy firms in our sample. We identify hybrid strategy firms as those with business strategy scores between 15 and 21 inclusive. We exclude observations with business strategy scores in the gray zones (between 12 and 14 and between 22 and 24 inclusive) to allow for a clearer separation between pure and hybrid strategy firms in our sample. Our main test variable, PURITY, is coded as 1 if the firm follows a pure business strategy, and 0 otherwise. We also use two alternative test variables, PRODDIFF and COSTLEAD, that are coded as 1 if the firm follows a pure product differentiation or cost leadership strategy, respectively, and 0 otherwise.

Control Variables
Following [144] and [49], we control for firm size using the market value of equity (SIZE) since smaller firms are likely to be charged a higher risk premium. We also control for the book-to-market ratio (BM) since undervalued stocks (high BM) are expected to experience abnormally high implied risk premium until the mispricing is corrected. We control for profitability using return on assets (ROA) without predicting a direction on its effect based on the contrasting evidence on how profitability affects the cost of equity capital ([80]; [174]; [49]). Additionally, we control for financial leverage (FINLEV) because firms with a high proportion of debt are expected to be riskier, and operating leverage (OPLEV) to account for differences between the cost structure of firms. We also control for stock return over the fiscal year (MOMENTUM) because prior studies show that momentum is negatively associated with firm-specific risk ([49]) and volatility of analysts' earnings forecasts ([122]). Further, since analysts' forecast properties can explain differences in the cross-sectional equity risk premium, analysts' long-term growth in earnings forecasts (LTG) and analysts' one-year-ahead earnings forecast dispersion (DISP) are also included in the model ([73]). We control for industry concentration measured by the Herfindahl index (HHI) and expect it to be negatively related to the cost of equity, as [92] suggest that firms in highly concentrated industries (i.e., higher HHI) are less risky due to barriers to entry. Additionally, following [71], we control for industry risk premium by including the industry mean cost of equity capital (INDCOC). Next, we incorporate the three [60] risk factor loadings (BMKT, BSMB, and BHML) in the model.[16] We also control for idiosyncratic risk (IDRISK) that is measured as the annualized standard deviation of the residuals from regressing daily individual stock returns over the fiscal year on the contemporaneous CRSP value-weighted market returns corrected for nonsynchronous trading following [173], and the Chicago Fed National Index (CFNAI) developed by [181],[17] since prior studies show that investor holding bias, market imperfections, and macroeconomic conditions can affect equity pricing ([183]; [194]; [49]). To reduce the possibility that the business strategy measure captures firm life cycle and managerial business acumen, we control for the managerial ability measure (MGR_ABILITY) developed in [44],[18] and follow the empirical methodology of [50] to identify and control for four of the five stages in firm life cycle (INTRO, GROWTH, MATURE, SHAKEOUT). Finally, we include year dummies to control for time differences in the implied cost of equity capital.[19] All continuous variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles to reduce the effect of outliers.

Data
Our sample comprises nonutility and nonfinancial U.S. firms with the necessary data to compute the implied cost of equity proxies and independent variables from the I/B/E/S and CRSP/Compustat Merged databases during the period 2000 through 2014.[20] The data required to compute the implied cost of equity capital are obtained from I/B/E/S and include ( 1) the mean of earnings forecast per share for one, two, and three years ahead (FY1, FY2, and FY3, respectively), and ( 2) the mean of analysts' estimates of the long-term growth rate (LTG).[21] Data items obtained from the CRSP/Compustat Merged database include ( 1) stock price, ( 2) book value of equity per share, ( 3) dividends per share, and ( 4) actual earnings per share. We also require firms to possess Compustat data necessary for constructing the test and control variables included in our regression analyses. We then exclude firm-years without analyst forecast dispersion, firm-years with negative earnings per share or negative long-term growth, firm-years with the stock price below $0.50 or the stock price above $500, and firm-years with insufficient data for the estimation of the risk factors. Our final sample consists of 8,036 firm-years.

IV. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
Panel A of Table 1 reports the descriptive statistics on our implied cost of equity proxies across the full sample and the subsamples of firms following the pure (PURITY = 1) and hybrid (PURITY = 0) business strategies. Similar to prior studies (K. Chen, Z. Chen, and Wei 2011; [28]), we find that our largest mean implied cost of equity estimate of 13.21 percent is produced by the [55] model (rEST), while the [71] model (rGLS) generates the smallest mean implied cost of equity (6.50 percent). Tests of differences based on the descriptive statistics for the average-based, [37] (rCT), and [71] (rGLS) models suggest significantly (p < 0.05) lower implied cost of equity (based on Wilcoxon Z-statistics) accruing to firms that follow a pure strategy. However, these univariate results should be interpreted with caution because they are obtained without controlling for the other determinants of the implied cost of equity capital.

Graph: TABLE 1 Descriptive Statistics

Panel B reports the summary statistics on the test and control variables. The mean value of PURITY (0.0850) suggests that, on average, approximately 8.5 percent of our sample firms follow a pure strategy. Descriptive statistics on the control variables are similar to the corresponding values reported in prior studies (e.g., [47]; [144]; [49]). These summary statistics also reveal statistically significant (p < 0.10) differences between the mean and median values of ROA, FINLEV, OPLEV, BHML,INTRO, GROWTH, MATURE, SHAKEOUT, and MGR_ABILITY across firms with pure and hybrid business strategies, which highlights the importance of controlling for these variables when investigating the effect of business strategy on the implied cost of equity capital.[22]

V. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS
Table 2 reports the results from the regression of the average implied cost of equity (rAVG) on the test variable (PURITY) and the control variables.[23] The results indicate that the coefficient on PURITY is negative and statistically significant (p < 0.01), suggesting that firms that follow a pure strategy (i.e., either pure product differentiation or pure cost leadership strategy) are associated with a lower implied cost of equity capital. The size of the coefficient on PURITY infers a decrease of around 59 basis points in the cost of equity moving from a hybrid to a pure business strategy. The results for the control variables indicate that rAVG is negatively and significantly (p < 0.10) associated with SIZE, ROA, MOMENTUM, and GROWTH, and positively and significantly (p < 0.10) associated with BM, FINLEV, OPLEV, LTG, INDCOC, BMKT, IDRISK, and MGR_ABILITY. Our findings for the control variables are consistent with our expectations and results reported in prior studies ([71]; [73]; [47]; [144]; [49]). The independent variables collectively capture approximately 50.56 percent of the variation in the average implied cost of equity capital.[24]

To assess the sensitivity of our main findings to the different individual measures of the implied cost of equity, we re-estimate our main regression analysis reported in Table 2 based on the four individual implied cost of equity capital measures (rEST, rCT, rGM, and rGLS). The results from this analysis, reported in Table 3, reveal a negative and significant (p < 0.05 or better) relationship between these individual proxies and PURITY. In terms of magnitude, the largest average decrease in the implied cost of equity, if a firm moves from a hybrid to a pure business strategy, is for the rCT measure (68 basis points reduction), and the smallest is for the rGM measure (29 basis points reduction). The results for the control variables are qualitatively similar to those reported in Table 2. Overall, the results reported in Table 3 suggest that our main findings are not sensitive to the measurement of our implied cost of equity. As such, for sake of brevity, we report the remaining results in our study based on the average measure of the implied cost of equity (rAVG).

Graph: TABLE 3 Results from the Regressions of Individual Measures of Implied Cost of Equity on Pure Business Strategy (PURITY) and Control Variables

One limitation of the analyses reported in Tables 2 and 3 is that they do not disentangle the separate effects of the two pure business strategies (i.e., product differentiation and cost leadership) on the implied cost of equity capital. To address this limitation, we repeat our main analyses after replacing PURITY with two dichotomous test variables, whereby the first (second) test variable, PRODDIFF (COSTLEAD), captures firms focusing on a product differentiation (cost leadership) strategy. We code PRODDIFF (COSTLEAD) 1 for firms with a composite business strategy score between 25 and 30 (6 and 11) inclusive, and 0 otherwise. The results from this analysis, presented in Table 4, reveal a negative and significant coefficient on both PRODDIFF (p < 0.01) and COSTLEAD (p < 0.05), suggesting that firms following either of the two pure business strategies (product differentiation or cost leadership) have lower implied cost of equity capital relative to hybrid strategy firms.[25] Specifically, the coefficient on PRODDIFF (COSTLEAD) indicates that the implied cost of equity of pure strategy firms pursuing product differentiation (cost leadership) is lower by 67 (50) basis points in comparison to hybrid strategy firms.[26]

VI. ROBUSTNESS CHECKS

Change Specification Regression
Next, we regress five-year changes in the average implied cost of equity, from year t?5 to year t, on comparative five-year changes in the values of our pure strategy (?PURITY) and changes in the control variables. ?PURITY is defined in Table 5 and equals ?1 ( 1) if a firm shifts from a pure (hybrid) business strategy to a hybrid (pure) business strategy over the five-year period, and 0 otherwise. As such, we expect a negative coefficient on ?PURITY to align with our main findings. We focus on five-year changes rather than annual changes because business strategy involves a long-term resource commitment and, thus, it is unlikely to change significantly in the short term ([192]). A change regression specification allows us to effectively employ each sample firm as its own control, mitigating the potential correlated omitted variable problem in our analyses. The results from this analysis are reported in Table 5. The third column of Table 5 yields a negative and significant (p < 0.01) coefficient on ?PURITY. This finding is consistent with our main result and suggests that firms that shift toward a pure business strategy experience a reduction in their cost of equity capital.

Graph: TABLE 5 Results from the Regressions of Five-Year Change in the Average Implied Cost of Equity Capital on Five-Years Changes in Pure Business Strategy and Five-Year Changes in the Control Variables

We extend our analysis in the third column of Table 5 by identifying shifts in the values of PURITY that represent a definitive change from a hybrid to a pure business strategy and vice versa. To examine the impact of such shifts on changes in the implied cost of equity capital, we repeat our analyses in the third column of Table 5 after replacing the test variable (?PURITY) with two dichotomous test variables that are coded ( 1) 1 if firms shift from a hybrid to a pure business strategy, and 0 otherwise (?TO_PURITY), and ( 2) 1 if firms shift from a pure to a hybrid business strategy, and 0 otherwise (?FROM_PURITY). The results from this extension are presented in the fourth column of Table 5. We find a negative and significant (p < 0.01) coefficient on ?TO_PURITY and a positive and significant (p < 0.05) coefficient on ?FROM_PURITY. These results are consistent with our earlier results and the view that a shift toward a pure (hybrid) business strategy is associated with a reduction (an increase) in the implied cost of equity capital.

We further extend our change analysis by identifying shifts to and away from pure product differentiation and cost leadership strategies. Accordingly, we re-estimate the change regression model after using four dichotomous test variables that capture the incidence of firms shifting from ( 1) a hybrid to a pure product differentiation strategy (?TO_PRODDIFF), ( 2) a hybrid to a pure cost leadership strategy (?TO_COSTLEAD), ( 3) a pure product differentiation to a hybrid strategy (?FROM_PRODDIFF), and ( 4) a pure cost leadership to a hybrid strategy (?FROM_COSTLEAD).[27] The results are presented in the last column of Table 5. We find negative and significant coefficients (p < 0.05) on both ?TO_PRODDIFF and ?TO_COSTLEAD, and a positive and significant (p < 0.05) coefficient on ?FROM_PRODDIFF, suggesting that a shift toward a pure product differentiation or cost leadership strategy (away from a pure product differentiation strategy) is associated with a reduction (an increase) in the implied cost of equity capital. The insignificant result for ?FROM_COSTLEAD could suggest that firms switching away from a pure cost leadership business strategy may not immediately lose (i.e., take more time to lose) the competencies/benefits associated with this pure business strategy.[28]

Propensity Score Matching Analysis
A potential endogeneity concern in our analysis is that firms' choice of business strategy may be correlated with firm characteristics that we are unable to observe and control for. To address this concern, we follow prior studies ([ 7]; [116]; [118]; [162]) and re-estimate our main model using a propensity score matching approach.[29] To execute this analysis, we create a propensity score matched sample of firms with a set of similar characteristics that affect the cost of equity but differ by PURITY. We initiate this analysis by estimating a conditional logistic regression of PURITY on all control variables in the main model to estimate the probability of firms following a pure business strategy.

The logistic regression results are reported in the second and third columns of Panel A of Table 6. Using the coefficient estimates from the logistic model, we next determine a propensity score for each firm-year observation and then match each pure strategy observation (i.e., PURITY = 1) to a unique hybrid strategy observation (i.e., PURITY = 0) without replacement and with the neighboring propensity score based on a caliper width of 0.01, which results in a new sample of 1,342 firm-year observations. The results from the covariate balance checks, reported in the last three columns of Panel A, show that the mean values of the control variables are not statistically different between the propensity score matched pure and hybrid strategy subsamples, indicating that the matching procedure has been successful.

Graph: TABLE 6 Propensity Score Matching Results Based on Pure Business Strategy

The results from re-estimation of our main analysis using the propensity score matched samples are reported in the second and third columns in Panel B of Table 6. We find that there is a negative and significant (p < 0.01) coefficient on PURITY, confirming our main finding that firms following a pure business strategy are associated with lower cost of equity. The results reported in the last two columns of Panel B show that both product differentiation (PRODDIFF) and cost leadership (COSTLEAD) business strategies are negatively and significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the implied cost of equity. Further, the results reveal that the coefficients on PURITY and its two constituents (PRODDIFF and COSTLEAD) are similar in magnitude, implying that the decreasing effect of pure strategy on the cost of equity capital applies equally to pure product differentiation as well as pure cost leadership strategies.[30] These results are consistent with our findings reported in Table 4.

Other Robustness Tests
We evaluate the likelihood of unmeasurable omitted variables driving our results by following [66] and [114] and compute the impact threshold for a confounding variable (ITCV), which captures how highly correlated an omitted variable would have to be with both implied cost of equity and our proxy for pure business strategy (PURITY) to overturn the significant result for PURITY. The deduced ITCV of 0.0268 (untabulated) suggests that our result of PURITY strategy would no longer be significant if an omitted variable had a partial correlation of 0.164 (i.e., ?0.0268) with both implied cost of equity and PURITY. To assess the likelihood of such a variable existing, we examine the product of the partial correlations of all our control variables with PURITY and our implied cost of equity proxy. The computed impacts of the control variables are all lower than the ITCV for PURITY, suggesting that an omitted variable would need to have stronger correlations with PURITY and implied cost of equity, relative to our control variables, to invalidate our significant result for PURITY. We also employ two more checks to account for possible endogeneity issues; namely, repeating our main regression analyses after controlling for a lagged dependent variable (i.e., one-year lagged cost of equity measure), and replicating our analyses after including firm fixed effects.[31] Our results from these analyses (untabulated) continue to indicate a negative and significant (p < 0.05) relationship between PURITY and the implied cost of equity capital.

We also assess the sensitivity of our results after computing business strategy scores based on the ranked quintile scores of the six variables capturing research intensity, marketing, historical growth, operational efficiency, technological efficiency, and organizational stability within [61] 48 industry, six-digit NAICS, and six-digit GICS industry classifications (our main measure is based on two-digit SIC industries). The untabulated results from considering these three additional industry classification schemes continue to reveal a negative and significant (p < 0.05 or better) relation between PURITY and the implied cost of equity capital.

Next, we evaluate the robustness of our results to using different cutoff points in the composite business scores to more narrowly or broadly define pure business strategy. Specifically, we classify an observation as a pure cost leadership (product differentiation) strategy firm if it ( 1) has a business strategy score of 6 and 10 (26 and 30) only, or ( 2) has a score that lies between 6 and 12 (24 and 30) inclusive. Further, while we continue to exclude observations with the remaining business strategy scores to allow for a clearer separation between pure and hybrid strategy firms in our sample, we also assess the robustness of our main results to the inclusion of these observations with scores in the gray zone and assigning them a hybrid business strategy. Our untabulated results from these regression analyses continue to depict a negative and significant (p < 0.05 or better) coefficient on PURITY.

Another concern is that our result for pure business strategy may be driven by one of the six variables employed to develop our composite business strategy score. This would suggest that our empirical findings for PURITY are explained by factors other than the pursuit of a pure business strategy. We alleviate this concern in at least three ways. First, we examine the correlation coefficients between our dichotomous indicator test variable for pure business strategy (PURITY) and the ranked quintile scores of the six variables used to compute our business strategy scores. We find that all correlation coefficients are below 0.1197 (untabulated), suggesting that PURITY is only moderately correlated with the ranked quintile scores of its six individual constituent variables. This is not surprising, as we identify pure strategy firms as observations with values at opposite ends of the continuum of our composite business strategy score (measured as the sum of ranked quintile scores of the six variables). Second, we repeat our main analysis after controlling for the ranked quintile scores of the six variables. The untabulated results from this extension show that PURITY remains negatively and significantly (p < 0.01) related to the implied cost of equity capital.[32] Third, we compute our composite business strategy score after dropping the six constituent variables one at a time and using the ranked sextile scores of the remaining five variables to ensure the business strategy scores range of 630. The results from these analyses continue to reveal a negative and significant (p < 0.01) coefficient on PURITY. Collectively, these results allow us to alleviate concerns that our results for PURITY are driven by one of the six variables used to develop PURITY.

In our final set of robustness tests, we consider whether our results are driven by firm size and/or certain years in our sample. In relation to our firm size assessment, we repeat our main regression analysis after including an additional variable capturing the interaction of PURITY with our measure of firm size (SIZE). The results from this analysis (untabulated) indicate that the coefficient on the interaction term is insignificant, suggesting that the effect of pure business strategy on the implied cost of equity capital is not influenced by firm size. To examine the influence of fiscal years, we replicate our main regression analyses for each year to allow the parameter estimate on PURITY to vary across years. The results from the year-by-year regression analyses (untabulated) indicate that the mean estimate of the coefficient on PURITY from the year-by-year regressions is ?0.0051 and the t-statistic, computed using the time-series variability in the coefficient estimates as in [62], equals ?4.15, which is significant at the 1 percent level.[33] Additionally, untabulated descriptive statistics reveal that while the percentage of pure strategy firms ranged between 6.22 percent and 8.71 percent in the years prior to 2010 in our sample period, the representation of pure strategy firms increased to, on average, almost 11 percent from 2010 onward. Repeating our main regression separately for these two subperiods produces a negative and significant (p < 0.01) coefficient on PURITY in both subperiods.[34] Further, the mean coefficient of PURITY from our abovementioned year-by-year regressions is ?0.0049 for years prior to 2010 and ?0.0053 for the years from 2010 to 2014 ([62] t-statistic equals ?2.72 and ?3.49, respectively). Collectively, these results alleviate concerns that our main finding is driven by certain years in the sample.

VII. ADDITIONAL ANALYSES

Systematic and Idiosyncratic Risks
Inferences from the traditional asset pricing theories suggest that a pure business strategy should reduce the implied cost of equity if it reduces nondiversifiable systematic risk. To provide corroborative evidence, we adopt the approach used by [49] and regress firm systematic risk, measured as firm equity beta, on our business strategy test variable (PURITY) and control variables used in our main analysis. We employ equity betas estimated using both value-weighted and equally weighted daily market returns over the fiscal year, with both measures corrected for nonsynchronous trading per [173].

The third and fourth columns of Table 7 show a negative and significant (p < 0.01) relation between PURITY and value-weighted beta (BETAVW) and equally weighted beta (BETAEW), respectively. These results suggest lower (higher) systematic risk for firms with a pure (hybrid) business strategy, which is consistent with our main finding of a lower cost of equity capital for pure business strategy firms relative to hybrid business strategy firms.

Graph: TABLE 7 Results from the Regressions of Measures of Systematic (BETAVW, BETAEW) and Idiosyncratic (IDRISK) Risks on Pure Business Strategy (PURITY) and Control Variables

Recent studies propose that idiosyncratic risk is priced due to market imperfections and investors' stock holding biases, which can result in investors holding a less diversified portfolio ([125]; [69]). For instance, investors may prefer to invest in local stocks or stocks with greater visibility, and hence price locality ([101]) and visibility ([131]). Using a rational expectations model, [183] show that investors price both idiosyncratic and systematic risks. Consistently, [49] show that the increasing effect of major customer concentration on the cost of equity stems from both systematic and idiosyncratic risks. As such, we also examine the impact of business strategy on a measure of idiosyncratic risk by regressing idiosyncratic risk (IDRISK) on our strategy measure and the control variables used in the systematic risk analysis. The last column of Table 7 shows a negative and significant (p < 0.01) relation between strategy purity and idiosyncratic risk.[35] Collectively, the results in Table 7 support our main results by depicting that firms with a pure business strategy have lower systematic and idiosyncratic risks relative to firms with a hybrid strategy.[36]

The Effect of the High-Technology Industries
Although our main results suggest that both types of pure business strategies on average reduce the cost of equity capital by a similar magnitude, it is possible that certain industries (e.g., high technology) are better suited for firms adopting a pure product differentiation relative to a pure cost leadership strategy. The high-technology industry is characterized by volatile product life cycles and rapid product obsolescence ([193]), which places greater emphasis on innovation to respond to changing market needs ([97]; [108]). Successful innovation in this industry requires catalyzing the talents of and providing ongoing training to technical professionals, investing in information technology, and successful commercialization and diffusion of products to customers ([52]; [75]; [83]; [124]; [126]). Survey evidence indicates that successful innovation in the high-technology industry not only leads to the development of new products that instigate more sales, but also generates customer loyalty to products (MPI Group 2009). Academic studies have also shown that investments in innovative activities (e.g., R&D and marketing) help high-technology firms to create a long-term competitive advantage ([91]; [39]; [52]; [191]). Other studies ([188]; [128]) argue that these benefits insulate firms that pursue product differentiation initiatives during stock market downturns because of factors ranging from retention of customer loyalty to bargaining power over distribution channel partners. Consequently, investors prefer to hold stocks with high brand recognition and broader ownership of stock.[37] This implies that the negative effect of a pure business strategy on the implied cost of equity capital in the high-technology sector is likely to be driven by pure product differentiation firms.

We investigate this conjecture by restricting our analysis in Table 4 that employs two separate test variables (PRODDIFF and COSTLEAD) to test the effects of our two pure firm strategy types on the implied cost of equity in the high-technology industries only. The results from this analysis are presented in the third column of Table 8.

Graph: TABLE 8 Results from the Regressions of Average Implied Cost of Equity Capital on Product Differentiation Firms and Cost Leadership Firms in High-Technology Industries, and in High Patent MSAs, and Control Variables

We find that the coefficient on PRODDIFF is negative and significant (p < 0.05), while the coefficient on COSTLEAD is insignificant. Results from F-tests (untabulated) confirm that the coefficients on PRODDIFF and COSTLEAD are significantly different from each other (p = 0.0485). These results support the view that pure strategy firms operating in high-technology industries realize a lower cost of equity capital when they pursue a pure product differentiation strategy, relative to a cost leadership strategy.

The Effect of Regional Innovativeness
Similar to our arguments for the high-technology industries, it is also possible that firms adopting a pure product differentiationrelative to a pure cost leadershipstrategy thrive more in certain (e.g., higher innovative capital) regions. [161] argues that innovation and competitive success are often geographically concentrated. Innovative regions attract talented human capital and other resources, such as technology-focused universities and public research centers that can promote the capacity and commercial viability of innovation in firms that pursue such initiatives ([70]; [157]). Further, the clustering of innovative firms in a region facilitates knowledge sharing among firms and their executives ([14]), which can promote interfirm collaborations, the mobility of skilled workers, and the spinoff of new firms ([29]). Such benefits, together with the closeness to competitors afforded by clustering of innovative firms, enhance the competitiveness of innovative firms ([94]; [ 4]; [42]). Further, the continuous local government initiatives for promoting innovative solutions and the economic vitality of those regions ([57]) allows innovative firms in such regions to constantly benefit from the resources, even during economic hard times. This, then, should lower the exposure of innovative firms in these regions to systematic risk ([63]).

Cost leadership firms located in such regions are less likely to benefit from the innovation-oriented resources and initiatives as these firms are fixated on maintaining stability in production processes and resources to minimize production costs ([136]). In fact, [137] argues that cost leadership firms suffer from severe diseconomies if they operate in an environment characterized by changes (e.g., innovative region). This is because efficiency is compromised when cost leadership firms unavoidably alter configurations in response to external dynamism, pressures, and challenges. The above factors suggest that geographical regions with a higher concentration of innovation are more likely to enhance the competitiveness and lower the implied cost of equity capital of pure product differentiation firms, relative to cost leadership firms.

To provide insight into the effect of regional innovativeness, similar to the approach adopted for our high-technology industry analysis, we replicate our analysis in Table 4 after restricting the sample to firms operating in regions with high innovative capital. Following recent studies (e.g., [70]; [12]; [15]), we measure regional innovativeness (REG_INV) as the number of patents issued per capita (in thousands) in the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in which the firm is headquartered.[38] We assign MSAs in the top decile of REG_INV to regions with high innovative capital based on the entire population of MSAs with available data for REG_INV during our sample period.[39] The results from this analysis, reported in the last column of Table 8, reveal a negative and significant (p < 0.05) coefficient on PRODDIFF and an insignificant coefficient on COSTLEAD. Again, results from the F-test (untabulated) confirm that the coefficients on PRODDIFF and COSTLEAD are significantly different from each other (p = 0.0166). These findings support the view that pure product differentiation firms realize lower equity financing costs relative to pure cost leadership firms in regions with higher innovative capital.

VIII. CONCLUSION
This study shows that investors require a lower rate of return for investing in firms that adopt a pure (product differentiation or cost leadership), relative to a hybrid (a mix of product differentiation and cost leadership), business strategy. Our results also show that the lower rate of return accrued to firms with a pure business strategy is due to the lower systematic and idiosyncratic risks, suggesting that business strategy serves an important role in the equity market by affecting the financing costs of firms, which should be of interest to firms and managers. Our findings remain robust to a battery of sensitivity tests including using a change specification regression analysis, using a propensity score matched sample, controlling for lagged implied cost of equity, firm fixed effects, and replicating our analysis on a year-by-year basis. While our results indicate that both product differentiation and cost leadership strategies lead to lower cost of equity in our main sample, additional tests reveal that investors appear to require a lower rate of return from product differentiation firms, relative to cost leadership firms, in high-technology industries and in regions with greater innovative capital. The fact that many firms continue to pursue a hybrid business strategy is consistent with the view that these firms may not be able to successfully implement initiatives that can allow them to realize the benefits of a pure business strategy, even if they are cognizant of these benefits ([126]). Alternatively, while these firms experience a higher cost of equity capital, they may benefit from certain other gains that overweigh their higher cost of equity financing. One avenue for future research is to identify such gains. For example, future studies can explore whether the diversified strategical focus of hybrid strategy firms provides them with more business turnaround options when firms experience financial distress. Moreover, while we show that pure product differentiation firms have lower cost of equity capital than the pure cost leadership firms in the high-tech industries and in highly innovative regions, future studies can investigate the relation between business strategy and cost of capital in settings where consumers are less sensitive to brand prestige, which can result in lower cost of equity capital for pure cost leadership firms, relative to pure product differentiation firms.

APPENDIX A

Construction of the Business Strategy Score
Following [16] we compute the business strategy scores as the sum of the ranked quintile scores of six variables (research intensity, marketing, historical growth, operational efficiency, technological efficiency, and organizational stability) using the rolling prior five-year data within each two-digit SIC industry. This approach accounts for industry heterogeneity by comparing firms to their industry peers, thereby allowing for the possibility that firms with a pure product differentiation or cost leadership strategy coexist in the same industry ([16]). We discuss below how the choice of a pure business strategy that focuses on production differentiation would affect the values we observe for each of the six individual variables. Central to these discussions is the view that pure product differentiation strategy firms place higher importance on innovative and market-seeking strategies, which are achieved at the expense of stability and efficiency gains. Countervailing views would prevail for observations made from a pure cost leadership strategy, since firms that focus on pure product differentiation and pure cost leadership strategies reside at opposite ends of a continuum of business strategies.

To begin, firms with a pure product differentiation strategy tend to have higher research and development (R&D) intensity ([143]). We measure R&D intensity as the ratio of R&D to sales, computed over a rolling prior five-year average (RDS5) and expect higher (lower) values of this ratio to be representative of a pure product differentiation (cost leadership) strategy. Second, firms with a pure product differentiation strategy rely heavily on marketing expenditure in order to inform consumers and differentiate their products from competitors ([100]). We capture marketing efforts using the rolling prior five-year average of the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenditure to sales (SGA5), where higher (lower) values of this ratio characterize a pure product differentiation (cost leadership) strategy. Third, firms with a pure product differentiation strategy are likely to exhibit greater growth potential ([171]). We measure growth as the one-year percentage change in sales, computed over a rolling prior five-year average (REV5) and expect higher (lower) values of this ratio to represent firms that focus on product differentiation (cost leadership). Fourth, firms with a pure product differentiation strategy tend to have lower operational efficiency due to forgoing constant improvement in the standardization of their production processes and the diversified nature of their operations since they explore new market opportunities ([184]). We measure operational efficiency using the rolling prior five-year average of the ratio of the number of employees to sales (EMPS5). Employees in a pure cost leadership strategy are expected to utilize highly standardized business operations to generate higher sales ([99]). We expect higher (lower) ratios of the number of employees to sales to represent a pure product differentiation (cost leadership) strategy. Fifth, firms with a pure product differentiation strategy have lower technological efficiency, which emanates from higher turnover from new products and regular replacement of their technologies to facilitate innovation ([170]). We capture technological efficiency using the ratio of net property, plant, and equipment to total assets, computed over a rolling prior five-year average (PPE_TO_TA5) with pure cost leadership (product differentiation) strategy firms expected to be associated with higher (lower) values of this ratio. To align this variable with the other variables employed to capture business strategy, we employ the inverse of PPE_TO_TA5 as our measure of technological efficiency (CAP5) so that a higher (lower) value of this inverted ratio is representative of a pure product differentiation (cost leadership) strategy. Finally, pure product differentiation firms have lower organizational stability where employee turnover is high as a result of the transitory nature of their operations ([184]). We measure this using the standard deviation of the number of employees over the prior five-year period (? (EMP5)) and expect pure product differentiation (cost leadership) strategy firms to be associated with higher (lower) volatility in employee numbers.

Next, we quintile rank the above-discussed six variables within each unique year-industry (two-digit SIC industry) combination, whereby a quintile ranked score of 1 ( 5) is representative of firms with a pure cost leadership (product differentiation) strategy, and sum the six quintile rank scores to construct a business strategy score for each observation.

Footnotes
1 The importance of business strategy to firm stakeholders has been stressed in other contexts. For example, AU 311, Planning and Supervision ([5]) emphasizes the importance of auditors obtaining an understanding knowledge of a wide range of matters related to the business strategy of firms, such as the nature of the firm's business, its organization, and its operating characteristics.

2 Anecdotal evidence suggests that firms are concerned about how investors react to their strategic initiatives. For example, in 2018, Botox maker Allergan plc's CEO, Brent Saunders, announced an urgent review of the strategic options for the company including divestitures, acquisitions, splitting the company, and share buyback in response to investors' frustration on a 36 percent annual decline in Allergan's share price despite the Nasdaq Biotech Index increasing by 5 percent over the same period. Further, several of Allergan's top shareholders have approached activist investors to advocate to the company for a strategic change ([168]).

3 Specifically, our composite business strategy index is based on the sum of the ranked quintile scores of the six firm characteristics by industry-year.

4 Consistent with prior studies ([80]; [119]), our main tests employ a consolidated measure of implied cost of equity based on the average of the four different implied cost of equity estimates deduced from the implied cost of capital models of [71], [37], [73], and [55]. As part of our sensitivity tests, we show that our findings remain unchanged when we use the four individual measures of implied cost of equity capital.

5 Other studies propose that idiosyncratic risk is not easily diversifiable and is usually priced due to market imperfections and investor holding bias (e.g., [125]; [69]). [183] and [49] show that both systematic and idiosyncratic risks can simultaneously contribute to equity pricing. As such, we also examine the relation between firm strategy and idiosyncratic risk as part of our additional tests and find that firms with a pure (hybrid) business strategy are associated with lower (higher) idiosyncratic risk.

6 Indeed, prior studies show an imprecise and weak correlation between the implied cost of equity and the market-based measures such as realized returns ([56]; [152]). [41] and [129] find that the evaluation of the implied cost of equity and realized returns within the same setting may not necessarily produce similar findings.

7 Similar strategic typologies have been suggested by other researchers. For example, [132] identify three types of viable strategies (prospectors, defenders, and analyzers), while [186] also propose a typology consisting of three types of competitive strategies (operational excellence, product leadership, and customer intimacy). Moreover, [127] suggests that there are two strategies that firms can employ to remain competitive; namely, exploitation and exploration. Ultimately, these strategy typologies have similarities ([185]) that allow them to be categorized into two distinct groups. For instance, the central feature of a cost leadership, defender, operational excellence, and exploitation strategy is efficiency; whereas the product differentiation, prospector, product leadership/customer intimacy, and exploration strategies focus on promoting innovation, discovery, responsiveness, flexibility, and expansion. In this study, we use [158] generic strategies of cost leadership and product differentiation to refer to these two distinct groups of strategies.

8 A clear direction and focus on cost-efficient technologies, niche markets, and well-established products enable firms with a pure cost leadership strategy to facilitate routinization and economies of scale, resulting in lower product and service costs ([139]) and more rigid cost and overhead control ([180]). Strict cost control and enhanced efficiency also mitigate agency costs ([102]), increase firm value ([79]), and reduce cash flow risks and rates of failure ([32]; [88]; [59]; [19]). Consistently, [146] provide evidence that investors require a higher rate of return for investing in inefficient firms.

9 Upon the successful discovery or development of new markets and innovative products, firms with a pure product differentiation strategy will be able to conquer market shares, which reduces the business risk by creating a barrier to entry ([35]; [43]). Consistent with this view, prior studies show that shareholders benefit from significant product differentiation initiatives, such as successful patent registrations, which insulate the firm against competitive threats and future cash flow volatility ([150]; [140]; [81]; [87]).

We acknowledge that lower information risk presents another channel through which pure strategy firms could realize a lower cost of equity capital. On the one hand, stringent controls and extensive monitoring enable pure cost leaders to curb managerial opportunism ([102]; [58]), which can reduce a firm's inherent information risk. This allows investors to better estimate cost leaders' future cash flows, which reduces the cost of capital ([110]; [40]; [54]; [48]). Consistently, prior studies find that cost leaders display higher financial reporting quality ([16]) and more readable 10-Ks ([120]), which lower the cost of capital ([64]; [24]). On the other hand, pure product differentiation firms have greater visibility through R&D and advertising intensity, which attracts institutional holders and analyst coverage, resulting in better external monitoring, reduced information asymmetry, and a lower cost of equity capital ([93]). [131] and [117] claim that investors are only aware of a subset of securities, therefore they require a higher rate of return to compensate them for holding securities that they are less familiar with (i.e., low visibility). [18] provide evidence that firms with a pure product differentiation strategy have a richer external information environment, as demonstrated by smaller bid-ask spreads, lower analyst forecast dispersion, and higher analyst forecast accuracy, which can reduce cash flow estimation risks. However, we do not rely on information risk-based arguments in our study, as the effect of information risk on the cost of equity capital remains an open question in the literature ([20]). Specifically, several studies find that the relation between information risk and cost of capital is not significant or sensitive to research design choices ([1]; [41]; [38]) based on the premise that information risk is either diversifiable or subsumed by other risk factors ([95]). As such, we base our arguments on how business strategy affects systematic risk, which cannot be diversified.

These models differ in the use of analyst forecast data, future growth patterns, forecasting horizons, the incorporation of industry effects, and the role of inflation in determining terminal value ([80]).

[27] report that rGLS is not consistently related to risk proxies, whereas [77] find that rGLS is the best predictor for future realized returns.

As part of our sensitivity tests, we show that our findings remain unchanged when we use the four individual measures of implied cost of equity capital.

[16] rely on the [132] strategic typology to evaluate how financial reporting quality is affected by the pursuit of two different types of pure business strategies; namely, the prospector and defender strategies. In contrast, our study seeks to compare the effects of both types of pure strategies (relative to the hybrid business strategy) on the implied costs of equity. According to prior studies (e.g., [185]), pure strategies that capsulate a focus on product differentiation and cost leadership under [158] strategy framework align well with the prospector and defender strategies under the [132] strategic typology. As such, the use of the [16] approach allows us to capture firms embracing the pure product differentiation and pure cost leadership strategies with archival data.

Our business strategy scores align reasonably with examples of firms that pursue pure product differentiation and pure cost leadership strategies. For example, [98] in its annual report stipulates that "its business strategy is to operate as the lowest cost producer of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications. It aims to provide highest quality products and competitive prices, prompt and reliable delivery, and highly personalized service, by utilizing technologically advanced manufacturing facilities, adopting the low cost production capabilities, embracing sophisticated information systems, and providing appropriate training to employees." Conversely, [147] indicates in its annual report that "it is a leading provider of voice and language solutions for businesses and consumers. Through an R&D team of talented scientists, linguists and engineers, and long-term investments in research and development, Nuance pioneers innovation in speech and imaging applications such as text-to-speech and automated speech recognition that redefine how human and technology co-exist." Consistent with the stated focus of Insteel Industries, Inc. (Nuance Communications, Inc.) on a pure cost leadership (product differentiation) strategy, we find that Insteel (Nuance) has a very low (high) average business strategy score of 9.18 (25.56) across our sample period.

These three variables are measured using a minimum (maximum) of 20 (60) weekly returns prior to the firm's fiscal year-end and are expected to be positively related to the implied cost of equity ([144]).

We do not include industry dummies because our empirical analysis includes a control variable that captures the mean cost of equity capital in a firm's industry (INDCOC). Our results remain robust when we repeat our empirical analyses after including industry dummies instead of INDCOC in our empirical analysis. In a similar vein, while we do not control for firm age as it is strongly correlated with our proxy for firm size, SIZE (correlation coefficient = 0.40), our results are unaffected when we control for firm age instead of SIZE. We also find that our results remain robust when we control for the number of business segments, which is insignificantly related to the implied cost of equity capital.

We exclude firms operating in utilities (SIC 49004999) and financial (SIC 60006999) industries because their financial structures are different from other firms.

In cases where data on long-term growth rate are unavailable, we follow [47] and deduce the long-term growth rate as FY2  FY1/FY2 for firms with positive values of FY1 and FY2.

The significant differences between the values for the four lifecycle variables (INTRO, GROWTH, MATURE, and SHAKEOUT) between pure and hybrid strategy firms can possibly suggest that pure strategy firms spend more (fewer) years in the growth and shakeout (introduction and mature) lifecycle phases. An untabulated analysis reveals that firms do not experience statistically significant changes in the value of our firm strategy variable (PURITY) when they progress to a different lifecycle stage. This finding remains regardless of whether we consider changes involving consecutive lifecycle stages (e.g., a movement from the introduction to the growth lifecycle stage) or longer-term changes in the lifecycle (e.g., a movement from the introduction to the decline lifecycle stage). While these results suggest that firm strategy is unlikely to be driven by firm lifecycle, which is consistent with studies that highlight the sticky nature of and the monumental costs associated with changing business strategy ([149]; [135]; [30]; [84]; [34]), controlling for the firm lifecycle stages in our analysis allows us to account for any effect of firm lifecycle on the implied cost of equity capital.

Untabulated correlation coefficients indicate that the highest correlation between any two independent variables employed in the same regression model is between GROWTH and MATURE (?0.7633), which is not large enough to pose multicollinearity threats. The highest variance inflation factor is 3.3237 (for MATURE) and is well below the threshold of 10, beyond which multicollinearity may be a problem ([107]).

We run our regression analysis in Table 2 after excluding PURITY and compute the F-statistic specified by [78] using the R2 statistics reported for the regressions with and without PURITY to test the null hypothesis that the inclusion of PURITY as an explanatory variable does not affect the explanatory power (i.e., R2) of our regression analyses. The computed F-statistic (17.88) is significant at the 1 percent level, suggesting that the inclusion of PURITY adds incremental explanatory power for the cross variation in the implied cost of equity capital.

We continue to document a negative and significant (p < 0.05) coefficient on PRODDIFF (COSTLEAD) in Table 4 when we repeat our analysis after deleting all observations from firms pursuing a pure cost leadership (product differentiation) strategy, respectively.

A test of differences between the coefficients (F-test) on PRODDIFF and COSTLEAD (not tabulated) indicate that the two coefficients are not significantly different (p = 0.5268). We corroborate this by repeating our analysis in Table 4 based on a subsample of pure strategy firms only, using a single test variable (PRODDIFF) to differentiate between the two different types of pure strategy firms. The results from this analysis produce an insignificant coefficient on PRODDIFF, confirming an insignificant difference between the implied cost of equity capital of pure cost leadership and pure product differentiation firms.

We do not observe any instances of firms shifting from a pure product differentiation strategy to a pure cost leadership strategy, or vice versa, in our sample. The reluctance of firms experiencing such a shift in business strategy could be explained by the fact that pure cost leadership and pure product differentiation strategies require significantly different and incompatible investments, processes, structures, and resource commitments ([132]; [159]; [103]). This suggests that shifting from a pure product differentiation strategy to a pure cost leadership strategy, or vice versa, can be extremely costly for firms.

The hold out group in our Table 5 analyses includes pure or hybrid strategy firms that did not change their business strategy over a five-year period. Our results, including statistical significance, are unaffected when we repeat our analysis in Table 5 after deleting firms that pursued a pure business strategy throughout the relevant five-year period (i.e., our hold out sample in this analysis consists of firms with a hybrid business strategy during this period). We also replicated our analysis using only firms that retained a pure business strategy during the five-year period as our hold out sample. Given the low number of firms that pursue pure business strategies and have data available to compute five-year changes in our variables, this extension results in a very small subsample (n = 195). Nonetheless, we continue to find some results that are consistent with our analyses in Table 5. Specifically, we continue to find a negative and significant (p < 0.05) coefficient on ?PURITY and positive and significant coefficients on ?FROM_PURITY (p < 0.10) and ?FROM_PRODDIFF (p < 0.10). The coefficients on the remaining test variables retain the same sign as those reported in Table 5, but are statistically insignificant, possibly due to the small subsample size.

Prior accounting studies have attempted to address such issues by adopting the two-stage treatment effects procedure of [86]. However, [118] stress the importance of such analyses identifying an exclusion restriction that affects the selection (i.e., firm strategy) but not the outcome (i.e., implied cost of equity capital). Unfortunately, it is often difficult to identify exogenous independent variables from the first-stage choice model. This is even more difficult in our setting as we are unaware of any existing model on the determinants of pure business strategy. This is supported by the fact that we find (untabulated) low levels of correlation between our test variable (PURITY) and control variables (e.g., firm size) that have been previously found to explain firm behavior in other settings. As such, we do not implement the Heckman procedure in our study as our empirical results are likely to be nonrobust and unreliable if the exogenous independent variables are chosen in an ad hoc fashion ([118]).

A test of differences between the coefficients (F-test) on PRODDIFF and COSTLEAD (not tabulated) confirms the two coefficients are not significantly different (p = 0.5268).

Controlling for a lagged dependent variable helps mitigate the concern of reverse causality ([109]) while, similar to a change regression specification, the firm fixed effects specification helps eliminate time-invariant unobserved characteristics that may affect the implied cost of equity capital ([36]).

We find that none of the six variables are significantly related to the implied cost of equity capital, except for the variable capturing lower organizational stability (measured as the standard deviation of employees over the prior five-year period), which is positively and significantly (p < 0.01) associated with the implied cost of equity capital.

While our yearly regression framework is based on smaller subsamples, the coefficients on our test variable are negative for 12 out of 14 years, with the coefficients for seven out of 12 years being significant at the 10 percent level or better. To further assess whether our results for PURITY vary with time, we repeat our main analysis after interacting PURITY with a time count variable (coded 1 for observations in the first year in our sample, 2 for observations in the second year, and so on). The results from this analysis reveal a significant coefficient on PURITY (p < 0.05), but an insignificant coefficient on the interaction term, suggesting that the negative effect of PURITY on the implied cost of equity does not vary as we progress forward during our sample period.

We also extend our main regression after including an additional indicator variable coded 1 for post-2009 fiscal years in our sample period (and 0 otherwise) and its interaction with PURITY. The results from this analysis produce a negative and significant (p < 0.01) coefficient on PURITY and an insignificant coefficient on the interaction term, suggesting that there are no significant differences between the magnitude of negative relation between pure business strategy and implied cost of equity capital in the two subperiods.

The findings in Table 7 are economically significant. In relation to our systematic risk tests, in the first two columns of Table 7, given that the sample mean of the value-weighted (equally weighted) beta is 1.1647 (1.1770), the coefficient on PURITY of ?0.0667 (?0.0629) translates into a beta that is 5.727 percent [= ?0.0667/1.1647] (5.344 percent [= ?0.0629/1.1770]) lower relative to the sample mean. Using a similar approach in our idiosyncratic risk analysis, the coefficient estimate of ?0.0145 on PURITY in the last column of Table 7 translates into an idiosyncratic risk that is 4.25 percent (= ?0.0145/0.3412) lower relative to the sample mean.

We support these findings of lower systematic and idiosyncratic risks in pure strategy firms by using a regression analysis to document a negative and significant (p < 0.01) relation between pure business strategy and (1) future earnings variability using a five-year rolling window, and (2) dispersion of cash flow forecast issued by individual analysts for a year ahead (results untabulated). We execute our analysis after identifying and measuring future earnings variability (cash flows forecast dispersion) and the appropriate control variables based on the empirical models of [111] and [13].

Consistent with this view, studies document lower systematic risks for firms that pursue product differentiation initiatives such as R&D and marketing initiatives ([128]), new product introductions ([35]), and development of strong brands ([123]).

Data on the annual number of patents issued in an MSA are obtained from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database (https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/reports%5fcbsa.htm) and MSA population data from the U.S. Census Bureau website (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro.html).

Our findings are unaffected if we assign MSAs in the top quartile of REG_INV values to regions with high innovative capital.
