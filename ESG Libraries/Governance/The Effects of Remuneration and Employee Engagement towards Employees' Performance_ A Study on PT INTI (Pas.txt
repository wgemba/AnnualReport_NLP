I. INTRODUCTIONIn the midst of the global era every company must face intense competition with other companies from around the world. To be able to face the competition, the management has to realize it and develop a competitive strategy by offering more satisfying goods or services than the goods or services offered by competitors. Companies in order to survive in facing the economic crisis and maintain their competitiveness have to pay attention to personnel (HR) and technology.Human resources (HR) is an important factor and very decisive for the success and sustainability of the business. The effective management practices are strongly influenced by the role and management of human resources within the company. Although the company has provided sufficient business capital, the availability of the information and technological advancements of the company will not achieve its objectives, nor will the activities in the company run well without the role of human resources.Performance is the result of the work of a person both in quantity and quality in carrying out the tasks that have been given. According to Moeheriono (2012: 95) performance is a picture of the level of achievement of the implementation of an activity program or policy in realizing the goals, objectives, vision and mission of the organization as outlined through strategic planningorganization. A person's performance is related to realizing organizational goals because employee performance can describe the level of achievement of an organization.In the RoyaRashidi Journal (2015) stated that: "Performance management system (PMS) defines measurements and develops performance in the most suitable and effective way to enhance organization's effectiveness. "The performance management system defines the measurement and development of performance in the most suitable and effective ways to improve organizational effectiveness. This effective system requires managers to participate in ongoing processes of planning, coaching, assessing and reviewing (Saudi, 2018).One form of attention of an agency to employees is by implementing a strategy of providing compensation in the form of remuneration, this is done in order to boost the performance of its employees. According to Pora (2011: 3), remuneration is defined as a form of remuneration or compensation received by employees / workers from employers for the achievements given by workers in order to realize the company's goals. In an agency or organization, salary is one of the costs or expenses for the use of labor, as a system of remuneration that is at a reciprocal relationship between the organization and employees. Organizational achievement is always associated with how to pay for services or salaries that are given to employees on how employees perform towards achieving organizational goals.A positive relationship between the company and its employees needs to be established in order to improve the performance of its employees. When employees have a good relationship with the company, the employee will give the best to the company. This is supported by research conducted by practitioners and academics who say that there is a positive result of employee engagement, such as a positive relationship with the organization that can lead to better performance and profitability (Choo et al, 2013).PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Persero) or abbreviated as INTI is a State-Owned Enterprise (BUMN) engaged in telecommunications which for more than 3 decades has served as the main supplier of the construction of a national telephone network organized by PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk and PT IndosatTbk.The purpose of the establishment of the company is to implement and support government policies and programs in the field of national economy and development, particularly in the telecommunications, electronics, informatics, electricity or energy, defense, and optimization of utilization of company resources to gain profits by producing goods or high-quality and highly competitive services, to increase the value of the company by applying the principles of limited liability companies.The effective performance is the hope desired by each company. To create good performance, the employees strive to achieve goals in order to get maximum results in carrying out tasks in accordance with the responsibilities that have been given to achieve company goals. So that there is harmony between the company and employees and create a good work environment. With the existence of a good work environment, it is expected to increase the number of profits.In 2013 to 2016 PT. INTI experiences a significant decrease in profits and can be seen in the graph below:Graph 1.1 above explain that the development of profit (loss) of PT. INTI experienced a reduction seen in 2014 a decrease with a difference of 124,349.1 million Rupiah. In 2015 there was an increase in profit to 482,320.4 million Rupiahs, but in 2016 there was a decreasein return to 333,565.3 million Rupiah. Based on these data it can be concluded that from year to year the profits of the company decrease.To find out the existing remuneration problems, the author conducted interviews with several employees of PT. INTI, according to the respondents there are several things they complain about, namely:The amount of remuneration is inadequate with the current level of needsRemuneration seems to be insufficient for the familyThere is no additional remuneration gained by employeesThe level of income between the lowest level employees and the highest level does not indicate a gap.These things can lead to demotivating behaviour for employees and become a cause of a lack of maximum employee contribution to the company, which ultimately decreases employee performance.Based on the facts existed in company data from year to year the number of employees at PT. INTI continues to decrease. For example in 2014 the number of employees as many as 759 people decreased in 2015 to 650 people. Even though the company has built good ties with employees in the form of education and training programs, providing the equipment to support the work of employees and other things. This becomes a question as to why this can happen.The results of Muhammad S. and Anthon Rustono's research (2015) entitled "The Effect Of Remuneration System On Employee Performance Sub Directorate of PT. Pos Indonesia (Persero) shows that the remuneration system has a significant influence on the performance of employees of the Sub Directorate of HR PT. Pos Indonesia (Persero) Bandung. Based on the coefficient of determination, remuneration has an effect of 22.7% on the performance of employees of the Sub Directorate of HR PT. Pos Indonesia (Persero) Bandung.The results of Akbary's study (2015) entitled The Effect of Employee Engagement on The Performance of Pension Funds (Dapen) of Telkom Bandung, the results of testing simple regression analysis show that the variable employee engagement (X) coefficient is positive. This shows that there is a unidirectional relationship between variables X and Y. This shows that employee engagement has a direct and significant effect on the performance of employees of Dapen Telkom Bandung.II. RESEARCH METHODSII.I. Object of ResearchThe object of research is Remuneration, Employee Engagement and Employee Performance at PT. INTI (Persero) located at Jl. Moh. Toha No. 77 CigerelengRegol Bandung West Java, Cigereleng, Regol, Bandung City, West Java 40253.II.II. Population and Sampling TechniquesPopulation is a generalization area consisting of: objects / subjects that have certain quantities and characteristics determined by researchers to be studied and then conclusions drawn (Sugiyono, 2014: 148). Population is the whole of the object to be studied. The population can include people, plants, animals, documents or records that are seen as objects of research. The population in this study are all employees from PT. INTI which is estimated to 650 people.According to Sugiyono (2013: 116) the sample is part of the number and characteristics possessed by the population. If the population is large, and researchers are not likely to learn all that exists in the population, for example due to limited funds, energy and time, then researchers can use samples taken from this population. Thus what is learned from the sample conclusions can be applied to the population.The size of the sample in this study can be determined by Slovin's opinion formula. According to Umar (2008: 65), the Slovin formula is used to determine how minimum a sample is needed if the population size is known.Information:n = number of samplesN = populatione = percentage of accuracy allowance due to errorsSampling that can be tolerated (note: generally used 1% or 0.01, 5% or 0.05 and 10% or 0.1. Notes can be selected by the researcher). The population taken in this study is estimated to 650 people and precision or the significance level used is 0.1, then the observation size in this study is 86 respondents.The sampling technique used in this study is nonprobability sampling technique which is a sampling technique in where each member of the sample population does not have the same opportunity to be sampled (Suliyanto, 2011: 124). In this study, later the questionnaire will be distributed and distributed to active employees of PT. INTI.III. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONSIII.I.
