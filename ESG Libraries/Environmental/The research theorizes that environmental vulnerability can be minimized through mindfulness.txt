The research theorizes that environmental vulnerability can be minimized through mindfulness?based strategies, and redesigning organizing processes, so that richer thinking is activated more quickly among greater number of people all of whom try to update their knowledge regardless of the knowledge source. It empirically evaluates the effects of organizational mindfulness and mindful organizing on resources and environmental sustainability. The model was tested in a very appropriate setting—Saudi Arabia, where increasing demand for and supply of energy culminates in unsustainable resources utilization and rise in greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental vulnerabilities. Data were collected from Saudi firms operating in the oil and gas sector and analyzed using SmartPLS software. The measurement and structural models were evaluated. The measurement model exhibits adequate model fit. The tests for the structural models show that four (of five) dimensions of organizational mindfulness (viz., commitment to resilience, deference to expertise, preoccupation with failure, and reluctance to simplify interpretations) and mindful organizing are significantly related at 5% significance level. Sensitivity to operations has no significant relationship with mindful organizing. Mindful organizing is significantly related to environmental and resources sustainability. Moreover, mindful organizing fully or partially mediates in the relationship between some of the dimensions of organizational mindfulness and environmental and resources sustainability. The study is one of the first to integrate mindfulness?based approaches to sustainability and environmental research.

One major way to reduce environmental vulnerability is to redesign organizing processes, so that richer thinking is activated more quickly among greater number of people, all of whom try to update their knowledge regardless of the knowledge source (Weick, [35]). Indeed, environmental vulnerability can be minimized through mindfulness?based approaches and strategies of firms. The quality of the environment and a firm's strategic emphasis are connected and can be influenced by the firm's collective mindfulness and the ability to organize mindfully. This study to the best of our knowledge is the first to integrate the mindfulness theory into the strategy–environment models and to apply mindfulness?based approaches to environmental and resources sustainability at the organizational level.

The increasingly fierce nature of rivalry in today's business environment has led to the adoption of different survival strategies by organizations in the effort to stay ahead or at least cope with competition. Some strategies expose the physical environment and its resources to vulnerabilities, and others help to sustain it. As production capacity increases to meet rising demand fueled by population rise and excessive consumption, the world is threatened by unsustainable resources utilization and alarming rise in greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental hazards and vulnerabilities. There is no clearer illustration of this phenomenon elsewhere than in the Arabian Gulf countries where rapid economic, industrial, and social development associated with population growth (Naser, [15]), plus heavy reliance on oil and gas, which contributes between 80% and 95% of various governments' (export) income (Bahrain Economic Development Board, [ 1]; Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries: Annual Statistical Bulletin, [21]), continue to threaten the sustainability of the environment and resources. As mentioned earlier, this is why the sample of organizations in the oil and gas industry in Saudi Arabia is suitable and adopted for this study. Also, the need to focus on the oil and gas industry when assessing environmental sustainability has been highlighted in a recent article by Shvarts, Pakhalov, Knizhnikov, and Ametistova ([29]).

A reflection on the sustainability of the environment and resources, and the role of businesses and their competition strategies, bring to mind the concept of organizational mindfulness, which was originally developed to explain how high?reliability organizations avoid catastrophic blunders (Weick & Sutcliffe, [36]). However, the concept is now also used to typify organizations that pay close attention to what is going on around them. According to the authors, mindful organizations encourage a rich and proactive awareness and a capacity for action. So, what would rich awareness of environmental and resources un/sustainability and the capacity for action mean for mindful organizations? In this paper, the authors examine the relationship between organizational mindfulness, mindful organizing, and sustainability of the environment and resources. It uses validated organizational mindfulness scale as a starting point for the resolution of the conceptual puzzles, integrating different streams of literature and proposing an overarching theoretical and empirical research agenda and managerial practices for the future.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we introduce the mindfulness theory and its major forms, followed immediately by the study's proposed theoretical model and hypotheses. The next section explains the research methods, results, and the discussion of the findings. It concludes with the implications of the study and opportunities for further research.

Theoretical development and conceptual framework
Originally, mindfulness was studied at the individual level, where psychologists (e.g., Langer, [12]; Sternberg, [30]) conceptualized it as a state of alertness and active awareness characterized by openness to novelty, alertness to distinction, sensitivity to different contexts, awareness of multiple perspectives, and orientation in the present?paying attention to the immediate situation. Consequently, the work evolved to the level of the organization. At the organizational level, mindfulness involves preoccupation with failure, reluctance to simplify, attention to operations, focus on resilience, and the migration of decisions to expertise (Weick & Sutcliffe, [36]). Extant research has argued that consumer mindfulness has a positive effect on (resources) sustainability (Ndubisi, [18]), and organizational mindfulness facilitates the transformation of mindful consumption to opportunity by creating mutual value for all?planet, society, and business. Mindfulness?based approaches hold that individuals' and organizations' ability to achieve reliable performance in changing environments depends on how they think: how they gather information, how they perceive the world around them, and whether they are able to change their perspective to reflect the situation at hand (Langer, [12]; Ndubisi, [17], [18]; Weick & Sutcliffe, [36]). Thus, individual and organizational mindfulness?based strategies can enhance value and accountability—for the environment, resources, planet, and posterity.

Individual and organizational mindfulness
Individual mindfulness underpins organizational mindfulness. Mindfulness literature documents two streams of individual mindfulness inquiry—the Western perspective, which takes an information processing approach and derives from the work of Langer ([12]), and the Eastern perspective, which draws from the Buddhist thinking (Hede, [ 9]) and denotes a receptive attention to and awareness of present events and experience occurring both internally and externally (Brown & Ryan, [ 3]). A common emphasis of both perspectives is the enhancement of positive outcomes and the minimization of negative functioning in several life domains including behavioral regulation. For example, Peterson, Simkins, and Claudy ([23]) show how management of behaviors of individuals and strategies of organizations can help to maximize environmental quality and resources sustainability and to minimize environmental vulnerabilities.

Organizational mindfulness (Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, [34]) was founded on the Western perspective put forward by Langer ([12]). Weick and colleagues reason that active differentiation and refinement, in creating new categories to make sense of experience and more nuanced appreciation of context and coping mechanisms (Langer, [12]), culminates from preoccupation with failure, reluctance to simplify interpretations, sensitivity to operations, commitment to resilience, and deference to expertise (Ndubisi, [17]; Weick & Sutcliffe, [36]). All five dimensions have clear direct and indirect implications for the environment. For example, preoccupation with failure, which focuses on emerging failure, can stimulate concentration and potentially vivid insights into the deteriorating state of the environment and how the organization's actions and/or inactions contribute to that condition. Reluctance to simplify interpretations and sensitivity to operations increase the vividness of insight by replacing conceptual categories with awareness of current details (Vogus & Sutcliffe, [33]). By this, mindfulness can make the organization aware of the details of environmental deterioration or unsustainable resources utilization and also provide a vivid picture of its role/contributions to the problem and how it can help to ameliorate it. Commitment to resilience represents concentration complemented with vivid representation of errors as the means to achieve insights to future actions, whereas deference to expertise increases concentration by routing decisions to experts who are best capable of handling the phenomenon (Vogus & Sutcliffe, [33]). Mindful organizations therefore can gain insights into the strategies for improving the condition of the environment by clearly representing or defining the problems (recall the saying "a problem well?defined is half solved") through commitment to resilience. And by migrating decisions to environmental experts within or outside the organization, they can create and implement on effective solutions for any (environmental) failure or disaster.

Organizational mindfulness and mindful organizing
Organizational mindfulness (Weick et al., [34]) was founded on the Western perspective put forward by Langer ([12]). Weick and colleagues reason that active differentiation and refinement, in creating new categories to make sense of experience and more nuanced appreciation of context and coping mechanisms (Langer, [12]), culminates from preoccupation with failure, reluctance to simplify interpretations, sensitivity to operations, commitment to resilience, and deference to expertise (Ndubisi, [17]; Weick & Sutcliffe, [36]).

Organizational mindfulness has been described as a relatively stable and enduring organizational attribute that results from structures and practices implemented by top management or administrators (Ray, Baker, & Plowman, [24]). Although some scholars have characterized organizational mindfulness as mindful organizing (Vogus & Sutcliffe, [32]), others (e.g., Morgeson & Hofmann, [14]) present a definition that pitches both concepts as complementary to each other. According to Morgeson and Hofmann ([14]), mindful organizing is a social process that becomes collective through the actions and interactions among individuals (associated with the organization). On the basis of this complementary perspective, the researchers in this study argue and locate organizational mindfulness as an antecedent to mindful organizing.

Organizational mindfulness functions as a context creator by signaling what the organization expects, rewards, and supports (Ray et al., [24]). In signaling, top management prioritizes mindfulness and not subordinate it to other goals through their pattern of practice (Zohar & Luria, [38]) and their establishment of organizational structures and practices (Rerup, [26]; Vogus & Sutcliffe, [33]). For example, management inculcates organizational mindfulness when they look for multiple and deeper explanations for emerging environmental problems, pay attention to how the firm's operations and members' actions contribute to environmental quality deterioration, solicit the views of employees to develop strategies, and act swiftly to change course and motivate members to follow. In other words, organizational mindfulness can be measured by the extent to which management endorses structures and practices that ensures more mindful ways of acting, thinking, and organizing (Ray et al., [24]).

In the context of this study, organizational mindfulness plays out in a number of ways. Through preoccupation with failure, management looks for multiple explanations for environmental hazards or vulnerabilities. It considers whether that development is a symptom of a larger problem or an isolated local event. Reluctance to simplify leads management to attend to the environmental anomalies or disasters and seek to understand them and refuses to explain it away as the result of causes unrelated to the organization's (or its employees') actions or inactions. Sensitivity to operations manifests in paying attention to actual developments in the environment and in the organization leading to constantly reviewing its practices, for example, the organization's resources utilization, greenhouse gas emissions, or carbon footprint. Commitment to resilience enables the organization to improvise and bounce back from the setback by studying the situation, learning quickly, developing strategies for overcoming the problem, and acting quickly to contain it. Lastly, deference to expertise pushes decisions to any level, not necessarily those highest in the hierarchy, which may in this particular instance include cleaners, gardeners, garbage collectors, sewage attendants, or laboratory attendants who deal more closely or regularly with the problem source/s. This line of reasoning is supported by Weick et al.'s ([34]) observation that high reliability organizations make an effort to see what people with greasy hands know, because they as well as maintenance crews are so important because they are the ones most likely to observe the early, weak signals of problems to come.

Mindful organizing on the other hand is a social process that relies on extensive and continuous real?time communication and interactions that occur in briefings, meetings, updates, and teams' ongoing work (McPhee, Myers, & Trethewey, [13]; Vogus & Sutcliffe, [33]). It represents a dynamic process comprising specific ongoing actions rather than an enduring organizational characteristics. It is a function of the actions of organizational members particularly those in the front line (Vogus & Sutcliffe, [33]). Such actions are plausibly predicated on the level of mindfulness of the organization. Extant literature also shows that perceptions of organizational mindfulness (particularly mindfulness of top management) can undermine frontline employees' mindful organizing (Vogus & Sutcliffe, [33]). Thus, following the precedence established by Ray et al. ([24]) and Vogus and Sutcliffe ([33]), the five dimensions of organizational mindfulness (i.e., commitment to resilience, deference/migration to expertise, preoccupation with failure, reluctance to simplify interpretations, and sensitivity to operations) were conceptualized and modeled as predictors of mindful organizing. This relationship is cast in the following hypotheses:

H1a
There is a significant relationship between commitment to resilience and mindful organizing.

H1b
There is a significant relationship between deference to expertise and mindful organizing.

H1c
There is a significant relationship between preoccupation with failure and mindful organizing.

H1d
There is a significant relationship between reluctance to simplify interpretations and mindful organizing.

H1e
There is a significant relationship between sensitivity to operations and mindful organizing.

Outcomes and mediating role of mindful organizing
Mindful organizing has been described as a dynamic process comprising specific ongoing actions rather than an enduring organizational characteristics. Researchers (e.g., Vogus & Sutcliffe, [32], [33]) argue that mindful organizing results from bottom?up processes, enacts the context for thinking and action on the front line, and needs continuous reaccomplishment because of its fragility. Drawing on the work of Vogus and colleagues, the present work observes that mindful organizing would manifest in several ways, such as articulating the damage to the environment and/or resources, or mistakes members do not want to make; having an ongoing discussion of what is being ignored or taken for granted; having a big picture of operations and actions of members—a shared accomplishment grounded in social and interactive processes; and continuously reconstituting the processes as new ways of organizing routines to protect the environment and conserve resources unfold. The reliance of mindful organizing on extensive and continuous prompt communication and interactions means that through it, organizational mindfulness can be transmitted to the firm's emphasis—environmental and resources sustainability.

Vogus and Sutcliffe ([33]) highlight the usefulness of expanding the conceptual and empirical linkages between organizational mindfulness and mindful organizing and a wider range of outcomes. Taking up this challenge, the present study addresses two key outcome variables and dimensions of firms' strategic objectives—environmental sustainability and resources sustainability. Marketing and management literatures treat strategic objectives as one of the measures of firm performance, the rest being financial and marketing performance (Ndubisi, Capel, & Ndubisi, [19]). Past studies have considered the dimensions of strategic objectives such as the achievement of overall customer satisfaction, overall performance of the organization, and achievement of the strategic objectives (Sarkar, Echambadi, Cavusgil, & Aulakh, [28]) and overall quality performance and environmental performance (D'Souza, Taghian, & Lamb, [ 6]; Ndubisi et al., [19]).

Ottman, Stafford, and Hartman ([22]) suggest that marketers (and indeed researchers) need to think beyond just greening products; they should seek to achieve both improved environmental quality and customer satisfaction. In this study, environmental and resources sustainability is the strategic outcome of interest. Hence, the effect of organizational mindfulness transmitted through mindful organizing would lead to environmental sustainability and resources sustainability. On the basis of the preceding arguments, the study develops and tests the following set of hypotheses.

H2a
There is a significant relationship between mindful organizing and resources sustainability.

H2b
There is a significant relationship between mindful organizing and environmental sustainability.

The mediating effect (of mindful organizing) hypotheses are captured as follows:

H3
Mindful organizing mediates in the relationship between (a) commitment to resilience, (b) deference to expertise, (c) preoccupation with failure, (d) reluctance to simplify interpretations, and (e) sensitivity to operations and resources sustainability.

H4
Mindful organizing mediates in the relationship between (a) commitment to resilience, (b) deference to expertise, (c) preoccupation with failure, (d) reluctance to simplify interpretations, and (e) sensitivity to operations and environmental sustainability.

The proposed hypotheses were developed into the conceptual model in Figure 1 and were tested with the research methods discussed in the next section.

METHODS
The proposed model was tested using data collected from managers representing organizations in the oil and gas industry in Saudi Arabia. Both online and paper?based questionnaires were used for data collection from companies in the Eastern and Central Provinces. Ninety?two usable responses were received. The survey instrument consists of two main sections. The first section measures the main constructs in the study, namely, commitment to resilience, deference to expertise, preoccupation with failure, reluctance to simplify interpretations, sensitivity to operations, mindful organizing, resources sustainability, and environmental sustainability. The following working definitions of the dimensions of organizational mindfulness were adapted from Vogus ([31]):

Commitment to resilience is defined as discussing environmental errors and vulnerabilities and deriving lessons learned such that members are able to extract the most value from the data they have to prevent more serious harm or disaster.
Deference to expertise refers to migration of decision?making authority to the person or people with the most expertise with the problem at hand regardless of their formal authority when trying to solve a problem or error.
Preoccupation with failure denotes operating with a chronic wariness of the possibility of unexpected events that may cause problems or errors by engaging in proactive and preemptive analysis and discussion.
Reluctance to simplify interpretations refers to taking deliberate steps to question assumptions and received wisdom to create a more complete and nuanced picture of ongoing operations.
Sensitivity to operations is creating and maintaining an up?to?date understanding of the shared tasks and expertise, to enable appropriate utilization in the face of problems or unexpected events.
Mindful organizing is defined as a dynamic process comprising specific ongoing actions and a social process that relies on extensive and continuous real?time communication and interactions among teams during meetings, briefings, and work (McPhee et al., [13]; Vogus & Sutcliffe, [33]).
Sustainability (of the environment or resources) refers to a firm's act of stewardship of the physical environment and resources through emphasis on conservation and on quality protection or enhancement (Ndubisi, [16]).
The items for commitment to resilience, deference to expertise, preoccupation with failure, reluctance to simplify interpretations, and sensitivity to operations were adopted from Ray et al. ([24]). The items for mindful organizing construct were adopted from Vogus ([31]). The items for strategic emphasis on environmental and resource sustainability constructs were adapted from Ndubisi ([16]) and Cameron and Quinn ([ 4]). A 7?point scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree was used to capture the participants' responses to the items of each construct.

The second section of the questionnaire captures demographic variables including company size, the industry type, and the age and education of the participants.

Data were collected from Saudi firms within the oil and gas industry using key informant technique to identify senior/middle management who represented their organizations based on their expertise and knowledge of the research area. Key informants are viewed as appropriate respondents if appropriate selection procedures are used (John & Reve, [11]). Thus, using guidelines on selecting key respondents from previous research, key informants were screened and chosen on the basis of their knowledge of the research issues, their formal role in the organization, and willingness to respond (John & Reve, [11]; Ndubisi, [17], [18]).

SmartPLS v.3.2 software (Ringle, Wende, & Becker, [27]) was used to evaluate both the measurement and structural models for the proposed model. As an extensively used analysis technique, structural equation modeling is deemed appropriate for the early stages of theory development and for simultaneously testing various and complex relations among latent variables using a small sample size (Reinartz, Haenlein, & Henseler, [25]). Partial least squares (PLS) is considered appropriate for the present study because of its suitability for small sample size Hair, Sarstedt, Ringle, and Mena ([ 8]) and because this research is exploratory and its model is complex integrating the five dimensions of organizational mindfulness with mindful organizing (as mediator) and environmental and resources sustainability (as dependent variables), which has not been tested before in any study. Indeed, PLS is very suitable for this research study, given the relatively small sample size of 92 firms.

The measurement and structural models were analyzed on the basis of the conventional two?step structural equation modeling analysis suggested in the literature for proper execution of PLS statistical analysis (Reinartz et al., [25]). First, the measurement models were validated, and then the structural model was tested in the second step by applying bootstrapping to 5,000 resamples (Hair et al., [ 8]).

RESULTS

Measurement model
Table  shows the results of the measurement model. The standardized loadings were adequate, with most of the items exceeding the 0.7 threshold value. Some items, however, fell within the acceptable value of 0.5 or above (Chin, [ 5]). Reliability and validity were ascertained. All constructs displayed adequate composite reliability with values above the 0.70 threshold. The measurement model demonstrated appropriate construct (convergent and discriminant) validity. All constructs demonstrated a convergent validity where the average variance extracted values were 0.5 or above. Table  shows the discriminant validity assessment based on Fornell and Larcker ([ 7]) where each construct related more strongly to its own items than to other items in other constructs, thus providing strong evidence of discriminant validity.

Structural model
After assuring that the measurement model met the minimum requirements of constructs reliability and validity, the structural model was evaluated using the bootstrapping calculation technique with 5,000 resamples to generate the statistics necessary to evaluate the hypothesized relationships in the proposed model (Henseler, Ringle, & Sinkovics, [10]). Table  shows the results of the bootstrapping including path coefficients, t values, and p values. Four of the five hypothesized relationships between the dimensions of organizational mindfulness (viz., commitment to resilience, deference to expertise, preoccupation with failure, and reluctance to simplify interpretations) and the mindful organizing are significant (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001) except for the relationship between sensitivity to operations and mindful organizing (p = 0.936). The relationship between mindful organizing and resources sustainability (p < 0.001) and environmental sustainability (p < 0.001) is both significant.

Mediation analysis
In testing the mediation effect of mindful organizing in the relationship between organizational mindfulness dimensions and resources sustainability (H3a, H3b, H3c, H3d, and H3e) and on environmental sustainability (H4a, H4b, H4c, H4d, and H4e), the procedure suggested by Baron and Kenny ([ 2]) and recently revisited by Zhao, Lynch, and Chen ([37]) and by Nitzl, Roldan, and Cepeda ([20]) was applied. Table  shows the results of testing the mediation hypotheses. Test results of the mediation effect of mindful organizing in the organizational mindfulness–resources sustainability link (see Table ) show that the individual effect of each organizational mindfulness dimension is significant (a) and mindful organizing is significantly related to resources sustainability (b). However, testing the indirect effect (a × b) between each organizational mindfulness construct and resources sustainability reveals mixed results. For commitment to resilience, deference to expertise, and preoccupation with failure, the indirect effect is significant (0.138, t = 2.14; 0.232, t = 3.03; and 0.108, t = 2.09, respectively), whereas the direct effect (c) of each on resources sustainability is not significant. This indicates a full mediation effect of mindful organizing between commitment to resilience, deference to expertise, and preoccupation with failure and resources sustainability. The indirect effect of reluctance to simplify interpretations is not significant (0.141, t = 1.92), whereas the direct effect is significant (0.416, t = 2.56), indicating a direct effect between reluctance to simplify interpretations and resources sustainability and the absence of mediation effect. The indirect and direct effects of sensitivity to operations on resources sustainability are not significant (?0.004, t = 0.081 for indirect; 0.213, t = 1.77 for direct). This indicates that there is no direct effect of sensitivity to operations or indirect effect (via mindful organizing) on resources sustainability.

The results of the mediation effect of mindful organizing in the organizational mindfulness–environmental sustainability link are shown in Table . The relationship between each individual organizational mindfulness construct and environmental sustainability (a) is significant, and mindful organizing is significantly related to environmental sustainability (b). The indirect relationship (a × b) between deference to expertise and preoccupation with failure and environmental sustainability through mindful organizing is significant (0.160, t = 2.86; 0.074, t = 1.99, respectively), whereas the direct effect is not significant. This shows a full mediation effect of mindful organizing in deference to expertise–preoccupation with failure–environmental sustainability linkages. For commitment to resilience, reluctance to simplify interpretations, and sensitivity to operations, the indirect effect is not significant (0.095, t = 1.77; 0.097, t = 1.93; and ?0.003, t = 0.077, respectively). Similarly, the direct effect is not significant (0.169, t = 1.21; 0.063, t = 0.398; and 0.172, t = 1.07, respectively), indicating the absence of both direct and mediated effects between commitment to resilience, reluctance to simplify interpretations, and sensitivity to operations on the one hand and environmental sustainability on the other (Figure 2).

Theoretical implications
The outcomes of this study offer important theoretical implications. Although Vogus and Sutcliffe ([33]) suggested the theoretical link between organizational mindfulness and mindful organizing and possible outcomes, till date, empirical research linking organizational mindfulness and mindful organizing with outcome variables is nonexistent. Moreover, the integration of the mindfulness theory/constructs into the sustainability literature or models is even more limited. This study provides empirical evidence for Vogus and Sutcliffe's ([33]) theorizing. By so doing, the study has not only bridged the aforementioned research gap but also advanced knowledge in this area, being, to the best of our knowledge, the earliest empirical effort in the field of sustainability. The results of the bootstrapping analysis reveal significant relationships between four of the five dimensions of organizational mindfulness and mindful organizing. Specifically, preoccupation with failure, commitment to resilience, deference to expertise, and reluctance to simplify interpretations are significantly associated with mindful organizing. For example, the research outcomes support the notion that preoccupied with failure (i.e., do more proactive and preemptive analysis to understand the potential sources of error or conditions that can produce the unexpected) increases the mindful organizing process (the collective capability of the workgroup to detect and correct errors and contain unexpected events). Also, deferring decisions to experts on issues related to their areas of expertise irrespective of their position in the organization's structure or hierarchy positively contributes to mindful organizing. Likewise, commitment to resilience and reluctance to simplify interpretations have positive effects on mindful organizing.

The link between mindful organizing and resources sustainability and environmental sustainability is evident. Theoretically, there is supporting evidence based on our data that collective capability of the workgroup to detect and correct errors and contain unexpected events can lead to sustainable outcomes. Moreover, through mindful organizing, some of the effects of organizational mindfulness can be transmitted. There is support for much of the mediation effects modeled and tested in this research. The study joins many past similar studies that have demonstrated that the effect of some variables on others can be direct, indirect, or both. Examples include the mediation research/models by Baron and Kenny ([ 2]), Ndubisi ([16], [17]), Nitzl et al. ([20]), and Zhao et al. ([37]), to mention a few.

Managerial implications
Some of the practical implications of the findings can help to improve firms' strategies for advancing resources and environmental sustainability. For example, the outcomes of the study suggest that the more managers are preoccupied with failure (i.e., do more proactive and preemptive analysis to understand the potential sources of error or conditions that can produce the unexpected), the more the mindful organizing process (the collective capability of the workgroup to detect and correct errors and contain unexpected events).

The more firms defer decisions to experts and let them handle issues related to their areas of expertise irrespective of their position in the organization's structure or hierarchy, the more workgroup capability of detecting and correcting sustainability issues facing the organization can be enhanced and ultimately reduction of its environmental and ecological footprint. Management's respect for expertise and willingness to migrate decision to those individuals or groups with more experience in handling the problem and making the right decision (regardless of their rank) when solving problems can be empowering and beneficial to the collective workgroup.

Furthermore, greater management commitment to resilience leads to more mindful organizing as the outcome of the study shows. Management's commitment to resilience enables the organization to improvise and bounce back from the setback by studying the situation, learning quickly, developing strategies for overcoming the problem, and acting quickly to contain it. When managers willingly discuss errors/problems and learn from them, it brings about greater benefits to the collective workgroup from discovered errors and also timely recovery from the failure. For example, the errors of unsustainable utilization of resources and environmental degradation can be identified, studied, learnt from, and overcame through management's commitment to resilience and mindful organizing.

Lastly, as managers take more deliberate steps to question the on?hand assumptions in order to create a more complete picture about the current operation, so also will the collective capability of the workgroup increase. Through reluctance to simplify interpretations management can better attend to environmental anomalies/disasters and unsustainable utilization of resources by seeking a comprehensive understanding of the problem, engaging all members of the organization, and refusing to explain the problem away as the result of causes unrelated to the organization's (or its employees') actions or inactions.

CONCLUSIONS
The results show a strong and positive relationship between mindful organizing and environmental and resources sustainability. Thus, firms aiming to achieve high level of environmental sustainability and sustainable resources utilization should entrench mindful organizing processes as well as organizational mindfulness. By entrenching policies and processes that promote extensive and continuous real?time communication and interactions among members of the organization and teams through briefings, meetings, updates, and teams' ongoing work, awareness, interest, and actions can be mobilized to consummate responsible environmental and resources utilization and sustainability.

Moreover, the effect of organizational mindfulness can be translated into resources and environmental sustainability through mindful organizing. For example, Peterson et al. ([23]) show that mindful organizations can advance environmental sustainability through its employees' actions. The mediation analysis shows that mindful organizing mediates in the relationship between some of the dimensions of organizational mindfulness and resources and environmental sustainability. Thus, the effect of organizational mindfulness on environmental and resources sustainability can be transmitted through mindful organizing.

The study's empirical evidence for the positive link between mindful organizing and dimensions of organizational mindfulness (with the exception of sensitivity to operations which has no significant relationship with mindful organizing process) supports the notion that mindful organizations are effective at advancing the collective capability of the workgroup to detect and correct errors and to contain unexpected events (Vogus & Sutcliffe, [33]) and in creating sustainable environment and utilizing resources sustainably. It also corroborates past evidence showing that a firm's mindfulness?based strategy can lead to outcomes that are beneficial to its key stakeholders, namely, customers, employees, society, and the planet (e.g., Ndubisi, [17]) and also evidence that mindful actions of stakeholders (e.g., employees and customers) can also positively influence a firm's environmental footprint and resources utilization (Ndubisi, [18]). The present study corroborates these streams of mindfulness research.

FUTURE RESEARCH
This study opens up some future research opportunities. It was conducted within a single industry (i.e., the oil and gas industry) in Saudi Arabia, and most of the participating firms are large in size. Future research may include firms of all sizes and from several sectors and then examine the moderating role of industry differences and firm size. The outcome of this future study would aid in determining the extent to which the model can be generalized or contextualized and on what bases.

The consequences of organizational mindfulness and mindful organizing need further investigation. For example, evaluating their direct and indirect effects on organizational commitment to environmental quality improvements, corporate social responsibility, and cleaner production and distribution are important future research directions.

Future research may consider the impact of individual mindfulness on mindful organizing. The present study focused on organizational mindfulness, however, understanding how and under what circumstances do individual mindfulness affects mindful organizing will advance knowledge in this area.

Another important future research direction is to examine the role of organizational and individual mindfulness in organizational buying behavior by precisely considering the relationship between individual/organization mindfulness, mindful organizing, and firms' decisions on supplier selection, distributor selection, input selection, and technology selection, for example.

The relationship between mindful organizing and internal marketing is another useful future research agenda. For example, the role of mindful organizing in transfer of knowledge, creativity, and innovation capabilities among employees, among managers, and between managers and employees needs attention.

Lastly, and purely for the benefit of the research community, testing the different scales developed to study individual and organizational mindfulness and mindful organizing for parsimony, validity, reliability, and explanatory power is a good idea. According to Ndubisi ([18]), up until now, there is no known study, which has compared the explanatory power of these instruments.
